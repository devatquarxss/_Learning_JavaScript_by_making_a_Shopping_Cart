	console.log(no); // console will print no as => 1

		//But is the value no is also changed ???? 
	console.log(no); //NO . It prints 1 again 
	
	/*** So in above Eg. => it is pass by value method ,
		it means => we are not passing actual var (no)
		instead => we create copy of var no ,save it to toChange var(parametr)
		
		Now if it has to be pass by refernce , (done in c,c++)
		by using pointer ,
		=> the actual var(no) has to be passed  to the function 
			instead of copy no to toChange var and then pass.
		so, if any chng made in the function ,the the actual var is getting
		 passed the actual var(no) would also get changed
		 & next time in second console.log(no) would have printed	
		 2 .

	/**** Things only gets wierd in JS 
		when => u get into OBJECT PASSING

	var obj = { // an another  Obj init

	console.log(obj.value); // print 1 
	changeValue(obj) ; //passing whole Obj in function
	console.log(obj.value); //print 2 //why ????
		// how the f*** obj.value got changed ??
		//why javascript ?
		//whhy do you do that to me :(
		//i thot only toChange.value will be change 
		//not obj.value 
		// i thot a copy of obj is being created 
		//copied to toChange
		//but no no no no ! that's not the case 
		//here the original object i.e obj
		//is passed to function
		//and this is called pass by refernce
		//when copy is not created 
		//actual var is passed and if 
		//further changed inside function
		//chang is reflected anywhere the var is present
		
		/*** here JS is acting as pass by refernce ***/
		/*** f*** js , love js ***/
		/*** u f*** wht u love :P ****/
		
		/*** Now next eg. will completely f*** ur mind ****/
		// but ,
		// before that 
		//let see smthing more about =>
		//pass by refernce
		
		//so , in above eg .
		//js is not creating copy of no as changeValue
		//right ? 
		//lets dive deep what exactly its doing =>
		//so behind the scence =>
		// no copy created in memory ,
		// so , no two value of var stored in 2 different places
			//in memory in no two different memory loc
		//so , there is only 1 placce where the value of our var is stored
		//what we are doing by pass by refernce
		//we are creating pointer that is pointing to the same loc in memory
		// we value is changed their 
		//its reflected everywhere 
		
		/*** the was actual meaning of pass by ref ***/
		//now next Eg. =>
		function changeValue(toChange){
			toChange = 	{
							value:2
						};
			var obj = {value : 1};
			console.log(obj.value); // print 1
			changeValue(obj); // again whole obj pased
			console.log(obj.value); //print 1 ! why ???? damn
		}
		/*** IMP ->
			Javascript is effectively copying the reference,
			not the referred-to object. 
			When you call changeValue(obj),
			you're creating ->
				two (completely independent) references
			to the same object
			
			Outside of the function, you have obj, 
			and inside the function, you have toChange.
			They both refer to the same object in memory,
			but the reference variables(pointers) themselves are independent.
			
			That means that if you modify an individual property,
			you'll be DEREFERNCING the actual object,
			
			**** how???
			here how we are derefencing ???
			
			we are doing ->
			
			toChange = {
				value:2
				}
				
			we assign -> a new obj{value:2} to toChange,
				having key value:2
			
			so we derefernce this toChange pointer ,
			from old memory loc 
			to another memory location where this new obj i.e {value:2}
			is present .
			
			 you're changing the reference entirely. 
			 You're saying 'hey, toChange variable,
			 point at this new object over here, please.' 
			 This does not affect obj's reference in any way. 
			 obj is still referring to our original object.
