      //In an Object we can store an element & also its properties
      //Eg -> Cart Item Name,Its Price,Quantity etc
      //Object is collection of elements & its properties
      //As we can fetch an array element by its index position,
      //We can fetch an object element and its properties by its key
      // As an array is denoted by [] an object is denoted by {}

      // Benifit of Array - Keeps things in Order by Index
      // Benifit of Object - Very Descriptive
      //Therefore in Cart ->
      //We will use Array to hold items in the Cart
      //But, every item will be represented as an object
      //with descriptive properties

      //we cannot do for loop as count
